libtremor's source code is here provided in minimalist distribution format
with all source files not needed for compiling libxal removed.

- The project files were modified to fit libxal's binary output
  folder structure.
- Some project files missing in the original source distibution were added to support
  compiling the libxal on those platforms.
- Also, some code may have been changed to address certain compiler/platform
  specific problems and is so indicated in the source code.

libvorbis is owned and maintained by the Xiph.Org foundation and this distribution
is present here only for convenience and easier compilation of libxal.

If you want to use libtremor outside of libxal, it is encouraged to use the
original source distribution by Xiph: http://xiph.org/
